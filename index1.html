        <h2>What is TA</h2>
        <p>*Teaching assistants can be undergraduate or graduate students.</p>
        <p>*Teaching assistants grade papers, answer students' emails, make slides, and give course lectures.</p>
        <p>*Becoming a teaching assistant is demanding yet rewarding and can help you build your resume.</p>
        <p>*A teaching assistant is often a graduate student who serves either as the formal teacher or as an academic assistant to a professor. In other cases, they can be undergraduates.
        </p>
        <p>*Teaching assistants can work at colleges, universities, and professional schools. Their role can vary greatly from school to school. Some teaching assistants design and teach courses, while others are primarily responsible for grading assignments and fielding questions during office hours.</p>

        <h2>What Does a Teaching Assistant (TA) Do?</h2>
        <p>TA's job may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grade homework/exam paper, make slides</li>
            <li>Orignize class and check on class attendance</li>
            <li>Answer students' questions</li>
            <li>Assist Professor and give lectures</li>
            <li>In addition, TA should set time aside for Office Hour and hold regular Help Room to help students answer questions from class or papers.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>TA is a Demanding Job</h3>
        <p>Students will highly depend on TA.</p>
        <p>Receive course evaluation from both the professor and the students at the end of the semester.</p>
        <p>One should acquire high language and communicative skills, excellent learning ability, leadership and strong responsibility, and most importantly, confidence.</p>
            <img src="images/图片2.jpg" alt="助教图片">

        <h4>The Difference between Graduate & Undergraduate TA</h4>
        <p>For most people, when thinking of teaching assistants, what occured to them are graduate teaching assistants. A graduate teaching assistant is a person who is enrolled at a university studying in a graduate program.</p>
        <p>Most graduate teaching assistants are pursuing their doctoral degrees in their major. Acting as a graduate teaching assistant can demonstrate a specialization in your chosen field to a future employer and highlight leadership experience.</p>
        <p>For some doctoral candidates who would like to become professors themselves, assuming this position will give them invaluable teaching experience that can help them stand out on their resumes.</p>
        <p>An undergraduate teaching assistant is still earning a bachelor’s degree, usually in their junior or senior year of study. In their duties, they help a professor with one or more classes over a semester.</p>
        <p>They attend the class the professor teaches, provide the enrolled students tutoring, check on the class attendance, and often respond to student emails answering questions about the course.</p>

        <h5>What are the benefits of being a TA?</h5>
        <p>You can gain extra money to relieve your economic pressure.
        <p>You can work on campus and build your resume for your chosen field while enrolled as a student.</p>
        <p>You can demonstrate to future employers or graduate programs your work ethic, ability to communicate effectively, and ability to manage time appropriately.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, becoming a TA can help you foster a strong relationship with the professor who may act as a mentor and be a helpful bridge into graduate school by assisting you with applications and securing recommendations.</p>
